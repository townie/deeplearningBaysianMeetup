Take-Home Point 1
Deep Learning is nothing more than compositions of functions on matrices.

Take-Home Point 2
Bayesian deep learning is basically about learning a probability distribution for each parameter.



## Applying Basyeain to DL

Key Idea: Learn probability density over parameter space.


## PyMC3
Probablisty programming lang
